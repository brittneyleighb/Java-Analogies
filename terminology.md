## Classes and Objects

### Class
**Definition**: A blueprint or template for creating objects  
**Analogy**: 🏠 **House blueprint** - Shows the design but isn't an actual house
```java
public class House {
    // Blueprint shows: bedrooms, kitchen, bathrooms
}
```

### Object
**Definition**: An instance of a class  
**Analogy**: 🏡 **Actual house** - Built from the blueprint, you can live in it
```java
House myHouse = new House(); // Building an actual house from the blueprint
```

### Instance
**Definition**: A specific object created from a class  
**Analogy**: 📱 **Your specific phone** - One particular iPhone among millions made from the same design

```

### Private
**Definition**: Only accessible within the same class  
**Analogy**: 🔒 **Personal diary** - Only you can read it
```java
private String secrets; // Only this class can access
```

### Protected
**Definition**: Accessible within the same package and by subclasses  
**Analogy**: 🏠 **Family business** - Only family members and employees can access

    return 2025 - birthYear;
}
```

### Static Method
**Definition**: Belongs to the class, not to any instance  
**Analogy**: 🏪 **Store policy** - Same rule applies to all customers, not specific to one person
```java
public static int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b; // Works the same way for everyone
}
```

### Override
**Definition**: Replacing a parent method with your own version  
**Analogy**: 🍝 **Family recipe modification** - Taking grandma's recipe and making it your own way
```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "My custom format"; // Your version, not the default
}
```

### Method Signature
**Definition**: Method name plus its parameters  
**Analogy**: 📞 **Phone number** - Unique identifier to reach the right method

---

## Variables

### Instance Variable
**Definition**: Belongs to a specific object  
**Analogy**: 👕 **Personal belongings** - Your specific shirt, different from everyone else's
```java
private String myName; // Each person object has their own name
```

### Class Variable (Static)
**Definition**: Shared by all instances of the class  
**Analogy**: 🏫 **School rule** - Same rule applies to all students
```java
static int numberOfStudents; // Shared count for all students
```

### Local Variable
**Definition**: Exists only within a method  
**Analogy**: 🍳 **Ingredients while cooking** - Only exist during the cooking process
```java
public void cook() {
    int temperature = 350; // Only exists while this method runs
}
```

### Parameter
**Definition**: Input values passed to a method  
**Analogy**: 📦 **Delivery package** - Information delivered to the method

## Constructors

### Constructor
**Definition**: Special method that creates and initializes objects  
**Analogy**: 🏗️ **Construction crew** - Builds the house according to your specifications

    this.bathrooms = bathrooms;
}
```

### Default Constructor
**Definition**: Constructor with no parameters  
**Analogy**: 🏠 **Standard model home** - Basic house with default features
```java
public House() {
    // Standard 3-bedroom, 2-bath house

**Analogy**: 👨 **Father's toolbox** - Original set of tools
```java
class Animal {
    void eat() { } // Basic tool all animals have
}
```

### Child Class (Subclass)
**Definition**: The class that inherits  
**Analogy**: 👦 **Son's expanded toolbox** - Has dad's tools plus his own
```java
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() { } // New tool only dogs have
}
```

### Super Keyword
**Definition**: Refers to the parent class  
**Analogy**: 📞 **Calling your parents** - "Hey Mom/Dad, how did you do this?"

## Data Structures

### Array
**Definition**: Fixed-size collection of elements

```java
ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>(); // Starts empty, grows as needed
```

### Stack
**Definition**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure  
**Analogy**: 🥞 **Stack of pancakes** - You eat the top one first (last one made)
```java
Stack<String> plates = new Stack<>();
plates.push("plate1"); // Put plate on top
String topPlate = plates.pop(); // Take top plate off
```

### Queue
**Definition**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure  
**Analogy**: 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️🚶 **Line at coffee shop** - First person in line gets served first
```java
Queue<String> customers = new LinkedList<>();
customers.offer("Alice"); // Alice joins the line
String nextCustomer = customers.poll(); // Serve the first person
```

### HashMap
**Definition**: Key-value pairs for fast lookup  
**Analogy**: 📞 **Phone book** - Look up a name (key) to get a phone number (value)
```java

ages.put("John", 25); // John's age is 25
int johnAge = ages.get("John"); // Look up John's age
```

### LinkedList

    abstract void makeSound(); // Each animal makes sound differently
}
```

### Polymorphism
**Definition**: Same interface, different implementations  
**Analogy**: 🎭 **Actors playing roles** - Same script (interface), different actors (implementations)
```java
Animal dog = new Dog();
Animal cat = new Cat();
dog.makeSound(); // "Woof"
cat.makeSound(); // "Meow" - same method, different behavior
```

### Encapsulation
**Definition**: Bundling data and methods together, hiding internal details  
**Analogy**: 📱 **Smartphone** - You use simple buttons, don't need to know the complex electronics inside
```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine; // Hidden complexity
    
    public void start() {  // Simple interface
        engine.ignite();   // Complex internal process
    }
}
```

### this Keyword
**Definition**: Refers to the current object  
**Analogy**: 👤 **Pointing to yourself** - "I am talking about MY age, not someone else's"
